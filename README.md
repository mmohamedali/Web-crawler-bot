# Web-crawler-bot

It can be interesting to track search engine robots like Google bots when they are scanning your website, however sometimes these bots don't crawl every part of your website which can decrease your traffic. With This bot you will get accurate results of your site analytics and optimize your source code for faster speed. 

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
PHP (V5+) + MYSQL
```

### Installing

Open the folder "upload/track/". Then, open the file "config.php". You need to input your mysql database credentials on row 3-6, the admin area access (the id and password), and the array of bots.
```
ou can add use reverse DNS for verification. If you donâ€™t use reverse DNS then it is very likely that your data will not be an accurate reflection of actual robot visits.
```
Upload all the files and folders included in the "upload" directory to your webspace using an FTP program (smartftp). All files that end in .php and .html have to be uploaded in ascii mode.
In a PHP environment, run the "install.php" file
